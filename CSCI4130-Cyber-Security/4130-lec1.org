* The first class of Cyber Security

** How to *think adversaraially* about computer systems
** *Understand and assess* the security implications of computer and network systems
** *Attack* work in practice
** Defend against common attacks 

* Topics
** Security Principles

* The cyber Landscape
  ...
  -cyber-physical systems: car
  -power grid
  ...
* Why care about security
** It impacts everyone's daily life
   -banking, investment, school records, scoial media...
* Security is important for
    -confidentially of communication
    -data privacy
    -funcionality
    -physical safety
    -...
    -It may cause very very serious consequences
* Is not only important
** Security is also *fun*
  -Can you break a well-protected system
  -Can you stop the attacks
** Security in Art and in Science
   -A good mix of analytical skills
   -Dealing with very practical problems with real-world impacts
   -Considering a lot of trade-offs

* Is also challenging
  -WHAT IS HACKABLE:
  Everything, especially those connected to the Internet

  -Adversaries are *intelligent and powerful*
  They can induce nearly impossible faults

  -Difficult to reason about a system's security
  -Humans are very easy to exploit
  -*Asymmetires* between attacks and defenses.. **This content should be reviewed**
  -Security comes with *costs*
  -Negative property
  -Attackers can make profit from exlpiting 

* What is Cyber/Computer Security

* Threat Model
** Threat: A potential violation of security
** Cannot protect against all possible attackers
   -Why?
** High level goal is *risk management*
** Definition
** A threat model includes:
    -What to protect
    -From whom to protect
    -Assumptions
    -A list of the relevant..
* Attacker
** No attackers, no problems.
** Who are the attackers?
   ...Many kind of attackers
** Why do people attack systems?
   -Fun
   -Money
   -Politics
   -To destroy the world
** The reasons of attacks
   -make the attack non-profitable
* Users
** Humans are the most *vulnerable* part in defense
** Humans are stupid.. need to be reviewed

* Policies and Mechanisms
** Security Policy
   what is and is not allowed
** Machanism
* Prevention, Detection and Response
  Prevention aims to prevent sometihing abd happen
  Dectecgtion is baout knwoing that somehting is wrong
- False positives: wronmg alarms: 
- False Negatives: unnoticed attacks

Response is that we need to do when we have detection
* 
You cannot control the *inbound traffic* to you, DDOS cannot be prevent.
