#+TITLE: Symmetric Key Cryptography
#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper,12pt]
This is a simple form
* Cryptography
- A tremendous tool enabling secure communication over insecure communication channels -- /this is a narrow definition/
- The *basis* for many security mechanisms online browsing
- *Not* for all security problems, counterexample: /contorl hijacking/
* Three main goals
- Confidentiality
- Integrity: /prevent altering the data/
- Authenticity: requires/implise integrity
* Special guest
- Alice
- Bob
- Eve: the attacker
- sometimes Charlie

*More explaination*

- Confidentiality: Preventing Eve from learning the message

- Integrity: Preventing Eve from modifying the message

- Authenticity: Ensuring the message is from Alice

* Some terminlogies refered to slides
- Encryption
  Converting *plaintext* to *ciphertext*
- Decrypyion
  Converting *ciphertext* to *plaintext*
- Key
  A *randomly* chosen value used in encryption and decrypyion
- Cryptoanalysis
  Breaking the encryption/decryption scheme by analyzing the algorithm/implementation

* Crypto Algorithms
- Symmetirc: both key is the same

- Asymmetirc: two different keys, even more keys \newline

- One-way function: *very difficult to inverse the computation* (use
  permutation sometimes)

- One-way hash function: Generate fixed-length output given any input. /signature or verfication code sometimes./

* A live Example
*Then is the annoation with crypto algo involved.* /Refer to the
slides./

** Basic Concepts and Representation
   - M_i stands for the *plaintext*, which is also the *message*.
   - C_i stands for the *ciphertext*
   - K is the key for the communication
   - E & C is the encrypt and decrypt algorithms we use
#+begin_equation
    Enc(M, K), Dec(C, K)
#+end_equation

** Attakcer Side
   + *Goal*: any knowledge about M_i in addition to its length or
     about K
     - Slightly better than 50% probability at guessing a single bit.
     - Any information about the relationship between M_i and M_j

   + *Assumption*: K is *randomly selected and secret*

   + Recognition of success: Eve can generally tell if he has
     correctly and fully recovered M_i

* A Security Game

#+CAPTION: A Security Game
#+NAME:   fig:2

*Attacker guesses which box is E_k*

Actually, this is the recognition between *Random Message* and
*Meaningful Message*

* Evaluating Security

/Actually we don't want the same text get the same ciphertext/.

*A better encrypt algo(rotating algo): will be tested in the midterm*

For any polynomial-time attacker, the probability to win this security game is not signiÔ¨Åcantly greater than 50%

begin{equation}
Pr[A wins] <= 1/2 + e, (e.g., e = 1/2^{128})
\end{equation}

If 60% for attacker to lose(/high prob to lose/), is it a good scheme?

/Ans: NO. If attacker can always lose/
#+begin_equation
Pr[A wins] <= 1/2 + e, (e.g., e = 1/2^{128})
#+end_equation
Should use the explicit definition on slides.

* IND-CPA

*A formal definition:*
+ For any polynomial-time attacker, the prob to win IND-CPA security
  game is not significantly greater than 50%.

+
#+begin_equation
Pr[A wins] <= 1/2 + e, (e.g., e = 1/2^{128})
#+end_equation

This is a very strong security guaratee.

For the same plaintext, it generate diffirent ciphertext each time, *randomly*.

* One-Time Pad
* Two-Time Pad
* Block Ciphers
* Message Authentication Code (/MAC/)
+ Idea: Compute and verify a tag of the message that only Alice and
  Bob can produce
** With MAC involved
   + Alice
** Hash-MAC
- Most widely used and more secure.
- The only secret is the key
** Usage
   Use MAC with encryption together.
