* C Programming Review
- A structured programming language.
- Few reserved keywords.
- User-defined and compound types.
- Low-level access to computer memory.
- Map efficiently to machine instructions.
- Preprocessor => a separate first step in compilation.
* 
#+BEGIN_SRC c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
#+END_SRC
this is for the argument from the command line

* The comment style in C language
* The reserved keyword - 32 totally
* Data Types
** Basic data types
- char
- int
- float
- double 
In addition. there are a number of qualifiers that can be applied to basic types like
- long
- unsigned
- short
** Derived
*array*, struct, union, enum, *pointer*

* Naming conventions
  alphanumeric and underscore
* Operations
* Control Flow


* Pointer
- Pointer is a type of reference that records the address or location of an object or function in memory. A pointer value is typically a raw memory address.
- Pointer can be dereferenced to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to functions.
- A null pointer value points to invalid location. Dereferencing a null pointer value is undefined, often resulting in a segmentation fault.
- Void pointer (void *) points to object of unspecified type, and can therefore be used as "generic" data pointer. Void pointer canâ€™t be dereferenced, they can easily be converted to and from any other object pointer type.
